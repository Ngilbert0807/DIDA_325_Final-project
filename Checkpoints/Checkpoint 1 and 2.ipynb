    "We are data analysts employeed by the NCAA. We were given the assigment to study the given dataset to find any noticeable trends that should be researched further. We are going to focus on the Academic Progress Rate (APR), which is a calculation based off how many athletes on a team remain academiclly elligible and with the university. Most of the data within the NCAA dataset is not gathered by the NCAA. In fact, almost all of it is gathered by the member schools, and then shared with the NCAA. However, some of this data has been directly gathered by the NCAA."

We will be using the SCL_UNITID and SCL_NAME columns as well as the Sport_Code and Sport_Name to analyse the counts of sports by each university. This is important to see if schools generally field the same number of sports or if there's drastic differences between schools and analyze what could be different from schools with a high number of sports and those with a low number.\n",
